# Open Resume

Plan is to build an open-source clean resume that anyone can use.

**Some feature thoughts:**
- 🧑‍💼 Easy Cover letters
- 🏗 Easily editable / hostable
- 🖨 Dynamic Print / Web Version


Live Demo: https://open-resume.vercel.app/

## Todo

### Features to Add
- [ ] Add alt to images
- [ ] Add links (LinkedIn, Github, Personal Website)
- [ ] Print Optimizations
- [ ] Individual pages for a potential employer (eg, Conver letters)
    - [ ] These will have things you like / are interested in about the company and why you want to work there
### Smaller things to fix
- [ ] Ability to hide contact details so not everyone can read them
- [ ] Write a proper README
- [ ] Toggle to show logos / circle initials - rather than depending on whether a logo is present

### Future Features
- [ ] Some of your tweet highlights?
