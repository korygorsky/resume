# Open Resume

Plan is to build an open-source clean resume that anyone can use.

### Some feature thoughts:

- 🧑‍💼 Easy Cover letters
- 🏗 Easily editable / hostable
- 🖨 Dynamic Print / Web Version


Live Demo: https://open-resume.vercel.app/

## Todo

### Features to Add
- [ ] Making the sidebar suck less
- [ ] Print Optimizations
- [ ] Individual pages for a potential employer (eg, Conver letters)
    - [ ] These will have things you like / are interested in about the company and why you want to work there
- [ ] Key Experiences under work history
- [ ] Markdown for the text sections
  - [ ] Bio
  - [ ] Work History
  - [ ] Education
  - [ ] Side Projects
  
### Smaller things to fix
